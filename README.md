# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This Movie Recommendation System uses content-based filtering to recommend movies to users based on their input. The system leverages movie similarity scores to suggest the most relevant movies based on a given movie choice. Built using Python, Streamlit, and machine learning techniques, this app provides personalized recommendations in real-time.

## Features

- **User Input**: Allows users to select a movie from a dropdown list.
- **Movie Recommendations**: Once a movie is selected, the system returns the top 5 similar movies.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A clean, user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit to interact with the system.
- **Movie Data**: Uses a pre-trained model that calculates movie similarity scores to recommend movies based on content.

## Technologies

- **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web interface.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling movie data.
- **Scikit-learn (Optional)**: For calculating similarity scores between movies (if used in your project).
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading pre-trained models and data files.
